<h1>D3: Analogue Circuit Design Exercise</h1>

<p>Sasan Mahmoodi (Exercise Leader), Harvey Rutt , Alex Weddell </p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<br>-In this exercise, you need to design a multi-stage amplifier consisting of a common emiter and a common collector amplifier. Instructions on how to implement the exercise in the lab are found in<a href="d3coursework2.pdf"> Course Work</a>.
<br> 
<br>-A Design procedure for the circuit is also suggested in <a href="CircuitDesign.pdf"> Circuit Design</a>. You don't have to follow the design procedure in this document. But if you do, you need to describe the whole procedure in your report step by step by explaining how the equations have been derived, what assumptions and approximations have been made and etc.
<br>
<br>-Having completed the exercise, you need to complete the <a href="d3dcf.pdf">completion form</a> to deliver your work in the lab. 


<h2>Key dates</h2>
<br>D3 exercises will be on 13/02/2015, 16/02/2015.
<br>
<br>Report submission date will be a week after the completion of the lab.
